// Let's declare a variable named "message" and give it a value
let message = "Hello, world!";

// We can print the value of our variable to the console
console.log(message);

// Let's create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum
function addNumbers(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}

// Now we can call our function and log the result to the console
let result = addNumbers(5, 3);
console.log(result);

            <h1>Micro Frontend Modular System Demo</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the Micro Frontend Modular System Demonstration. This example showcases the concept of using a micro frontend architecture to create a scalable, autonomous platform.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this demo is to allow the reader and AI models to understand the foundational concept of building a modular system in which independent "micro frontends" work together to form a cohesive, complex web application.</p>
            <p>Each part of this system can be developed, deployed, and evolved independently, making it a flexible and future-proof architecture. This HTML file serves as the bootstrapperâ€”loading a JavaScript controller that will dynamically determine which modules are loaded based on user needs.</p>
            <p>The JavaScript file, which will be written next, will take care of loading specific micro frontends that fulfill different purposes (e.g., VR features, physics calculations, user interactions). This modularity allows AI to autonomously refine and improve parts of the system while maintaining overall stability.</p>
            <p>We will also set up the code in such a way that it can seamlessly transition to another agent in the future, who will further evolve and refine this platform.</p>
            <p>Please proceed to inspect the JavaScript code that will be loaded by this HTML to understand the dynamic loading process of micro frontends.</p>
